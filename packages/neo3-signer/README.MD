  Neo3-Signer - A declarative Signing Spec.
  <br/> Made with ‚ù§ by <b>COZ.IO</b>
</p>

# Neo3-Signer
Neo3-Signer is a specification of how clients can interact with different signer libraries such Neon-JS or WalletConnect.
Taking advantage of the declarative nature of the specification, the same code can be used with different signer libraries.

Visit the [main page](../../README.md) of the project.
